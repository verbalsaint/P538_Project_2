P538 Project 2 

First Phase:
1.(shuohuan)	*Done
should take a file containing tcpdump data as its input and output the statistics detailed later in this document

2.(shuohuan)    *Done
Open an input file using function pcap_open_offline().

3.(shuohuan)	*Done
Check that the data you are provided has been captured from Ethernet using function pcap_datalink().

4.(shuohuan)	*Done
Read packets from the file using function pcap_loop(). Note that this function needs to be called only once. It takes 4 arguments. Of these, the second and the third arguments are of most interest to you. The second argument lets you specify how many packets to read from the file. The third argument, pcap_handler callback, is where most of the action happens. Here, callback is the function you write to process data from each packet.

5.(shuohuan)	*Done
You can pass the callback function to the pcap_loop() function simply by giving its name as the appropriate argument to pcap_loop(). The callback function must be a void function that takes three arguments, of the types u_char *, const struct pcap_pkthdr *, const u_char *. The callback is called by pcap_loop() once for each packet. The second argument to the callback is the special libpcap header, which can be used to extract the entire packet length and the packet arrival time (see the pcap_pkthdr structure in /usr/include/pcap.h). The third argument contains the contents of a single packet (from the Ethernet packet header onward).

6.(shuohuan)	*Done
Close the file using function pcap_close().


Second Phase:
1.(shuohuan)    *Done
Ethernet, ARP headers

2.(shuohuan)    *Done
Average, minimum, and maximum packet sizes. Here, packet refers to everything beyond the tcpdump header.

3.(shuohuan)    *Done
Unique Ethernet addresses found as both sources and destinations, along with the total number of packets containing each address. Represent Ethernet addresses in hex-colon format.

4.(shuohuan)    *Done
Unique Ethernet addresses found as both sources and destinations, along with the total number of packets containing each address. Represent Ethernet addresses in hex-colon format.

5.(shuohuan)    *Done
Start date and time, total duration, and total number of packets in the packet capture

6.(shuohuan)    *Done
Unique source and destination IP addresses, along with the total number of packets containing each address. Represent IPv4 addresses in the standard a.b.c.d notation. **Ignore IPv6 addresses.

7.(shuohuan)    *Done
Unique ARP participants, their associated MAC addresses, and IP addresses.

8.(shuohuan)    *Done
Unique source and destination TCP and UDP ports, along with the total number of packets containing each port number.

9.(shuohuan)    *Done
For TCP, report the number of packets containing each flag.
